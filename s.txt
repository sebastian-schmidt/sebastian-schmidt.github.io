The invasive potential of cancer cells strongly depends on cellular stiffness, a physical quantity that is not only regulated by the mechanical impact of the cytoskeleton but also influenced by the membrane rigidity. To analyze the specific role of membrane rigidity in cancer progression, we treated cancer cells with the Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase inhibitor Soraphen A and revealed a modulation of the cellular lipidome via mass spectrometry. Migration, invasion, and cell death assays were employed to relate this modulation to functional consequences and in fact a decrease of migration and invasion without significant impact on cell death has been recorded. Mechanical measurements of intact cells and Fourier fluctuation analysis of giant plasma membrane vesicles showed that Soraphen A increases membrane rigidity of carcinoma cells, even without changing the deformation behavior of the cytoskeleton. These data suggest that the increase of membrane rigidity alone is sufficient to inhibit invasiveness of cancer cells, thus disclosing the eminent role of membrane rigidity in migratory processes.

 
1. Introduction
Cell motility, migration, and invasion play a major role in cancer progression entailing spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant organs [1]. Formation of metastasis correlates with poor prognosis and is the main cause of cancer death. Metastatic cancer cells have to change their mechanical properties and lose cell-cell contacts to detach from the primary tumor mass, break through the basement membrane, leave the original tissue compartment, enter blood vessels, and migrate into new compartments. This highly coordinated process of migration and invasion not only requires rapid changes in dynamics of the cytoskeletal components to form membrane protrusions and traction forces, but also depends on alterations in mechanical properties of the plasma membrane [2]. Cancer cells differ significantly in phospholipid composition compared to their non-malignant counter parts [3,4] and changes in membranes lipid composition are strongly connected to alteration in bending rigidity [5]. Decoding cell mechanics of cancer is necessary to understand it from a biomechanical perspective [6,7]. However, current research is mostly focused on specific molecular and biochemical targets whereas research on a more general level like mechanical features is still an emerging field [8–10]. Identifying mechanical properties of cells and their membranes that affect migratory processes [11] is key to understand cancer progression and numerous diseases like Alzheimer’s disease[12]. Beyond that, it also opens the possibility to target and manipulate the physical characteristics of membranes. Until now, membrane affecting drugs exist mainly for diseases of the vascular system, such as hypertension [13]. Lipid components had a significant influence on motility and therefore play a role in cancer progression [4].
In the present study we characterize the impact of plasma membrane rigidity on migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells. Therefore, the key enzyme in the fatty acid metabolism, the Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC1) was inhibited by using the chemical compound Soraphen A. ACC1 catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA, which is the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis. It has been shown that inhibition of ACC1 by Soraphen A interferes with fatty acid elongation resulting in an accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and a reduction of saturated and unsaturated acyl chains [14,15]. While the functional consequences of ACC1 inhibition have been analyzed with regard to cellular growth and apoptosis so far [16,17], this study focuses on the effects of Soraphen A on membrane composition, mechanical characteristics and hence, migratory processes of highly aggressive cancer cells.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell culture and compounds
Soraphen A was isolated by Gerth et al. as described previously [18] and dissolved in ethanol. The invasive mammary carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 was obtained from Cell Line Services (CLS, Eppelheim, Germany) and cultured in DMEM media (PAA, Coelbe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). T24 bladder carcinoma cells were kindly provided by Barbara Mayer (Department of Surgery, University of Munich, Germany) and recently authenticated by the DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). T24 cells were maintained in McCoy`s 5A medium (PAA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S).

2.2. Analysis of phospholipids by liquid chromatography ESI tandem mass spectrometry
Phospholipids were extracted, separated by reversed phase liquid chromatography and detected by ESI tandem mass spectrometry as described in [19]. In brief, methanol, chloroform and saline (final ratio: 14:34:35:17) were successively added to the cells. The organic layer was evaporated and the residual dissolved and diluted in methanol. The extracted phospholipids were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C8 column (1.7 µm, 1×100 mm, Milford, MA) using an AcquityTM Ultraperformance LC system (Waters, Milford, MA). The chromatography system was coupled to a QTRAP 5500 Mass Spectrometer (AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) with electrospray ionization source. Both fatty acid anion fragments were detected through multiple reaction monitoring. The most intensive transition was selected for quantification. Mass spectra were processed using Analyst 1.6 (AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany).

2.3. Optical Stretcher measurements
Cells were detached from flask identical to passaging and resuspended in culture medium. Cell suspension in tube was connected to the optical stretcher setup [20], a dual beam fiber laser trap (figure 1(a)). Whole deformation measurement was recorded as an image series (30 fps). The microscope stage temperature was held constant at 23 °C. A minimum of 300 cells were recorded for each experiment.
 
Figure 1. Optical Stretcher setup. (a) Cells are pumped to the focus of the optical trap. After a cell gets trapped it is stretched with 800 mW and the increased diameter is recorded with an edge detection algorithm (b). The complete measurement pattern of a single deformation experiment is shown in (c).

An edge detection Matlab algorithm (Mathworks) constructs deformation data from the images and corrects for small angle rotations in the trap (figure 1(b)). Relative deformation e is the ratio of elongation and initial cell diameter d0 along laser axis, e = (d(t)-d0)/d0, and plots are shown as creep deformation J(t) =e/s0, with s0 being the optically induced stress linearly depending on the applied laser power PStretch (figure 1(c)) [21,22]. Creep deformation J is shown as median, appropriate for the non-Gaussian distribution of the data, and bootstrapping was used to estimate 95% confidence interval. Additionally, a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to control if the data are from different distributions at the end of the stretch phase.

2.4. Giant plasma membrane vesicles
Prior vesiculation, cells were grown to 90% confluence in 75 cm2 tissue flasks. The culture medium was removed and rinsed with a buffer solution composed of 150 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S7653), 10 mM 2-(4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl)- ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA, H3375) and 2 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, C5080). Buffer ingredients, DTT (Roth, 6908) and PFA (Sigma-Aldrich, P6148) powder were dissolved in ultra-pure water (Milli-Q system Integral 5, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, R > 18 MO cm). Afterwards, cells were incubated in a shaker (37 °C, 5% CO2 and 60 cycle min-1) for 120 min in 2.5 ml buffer, containing 25 mM PFA and 4 mM DTT. After shaking, the content was settled on ice for about 45 min. In order to observe GPMVs, the upper ¾ of the solution was pipetted on an object plate for imaging (optical phase contrast microscope, 100× magnification, LEICA DM IRB).

2.5. Fourier analysis of thermally excited membrane fluctuations
The theoretical background was introduced by Helfrich in 1973 [23]. He proposed the curvature energy per unit area of bilayers:
 									(1)
where c0 is the spontaneous curvature and c1 and c2 principle curvatures. More than 10 years later, Schneider extended Helfrich’s model to quasi-spherical vesicles [24]. Schneider described thermally excited membrane fluctuations using displacements u(?,?,t) of a vesicle from its spherical form and decomposed them in spherical harmonic eigenfunctions Ylq(?,?):
 								(2)
alq(t) are time-dependent amplitudes, ? the polar angle, ? the azimuthal angle, l the azimuthal, and q the magnetic quantum number. States with l < 2 correspond to spherical translations and violate volume conservation. Provided the thermally excited modes follow the equipartition theorem, mean square amplitudes alq from each spherical harmonic can be calculated:
 						(3)
T denotes the temperature, kB the Boltzmann constant, and ?' the effective tension. The expected value is calculated as ensemble average.
An ensemble of n images (?10,000) per vesicle was recorded with an iXon camera (Andor, UK) while the vesicles were observed by phase contrast microscopy. We worked with acquisition times of about 1 min and rates between 90 and 150 frames per second to guarantee that blebs were able to constitute most of its available configurations [25].
Engelhardt et al. used Fourier analysis of the observed 2D vesicle contour R(?) to correlate the observed fluctuating forms to Schneider’s 3D theory [26]. In order to detect the vesicles contour a Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick) gradient based edge detection algorithm was used describing the shape of each vesicle with 256 radii R(?i). ?i denotes the azimuthal angle in the image plane (? = ?/2). Engelhard et al. expressed relative deformations u(?,t) of the vesicle as amplitudes Vq(t) in the equatorial plane using Fourier transformation:
 									(4)
and expressed the mean square values of the amplitudes Vq(t) using eq. (2) and (3):
 .						(5)
<?Vq?²> was estimated by averaging Vq over the number of taken images n per vesicle. NlqP(q)l (0) denote the fully normalized associated Legendre functions in the image plane and q the mode number. We realized the Fourier transformation from eq. (4) with a discrete transformation to get discrete coefficients. Engelhardt further suggested a simplification for negligible tensions:
 .								(6)
The influence of effective tension s' was checked with a two-parameter fit. We found larger differences between bending rigidity of Soraphen A treated cells and control cells than tension is able to affect the bending elastic modulus. For that reason eq. (6) was used to determine ?. R denotes the average radius of vesicle obtained from all images n. The sum in eq. (6) was estimated up to the 34th order [26]. As it was discussed in [26,27] only modes 2 < q < 9 were used to determine the bending rigidity of vesicles in the present work. In that range constant bending rigidities were observed.

2.6. Migration and invasion assay
2x105 MDA-MB-231 or T24 cells, respectively, were seeded in a 6-well plate and stimulated with Soraphen A for 2 h. For MDA-MB-231 8 µm inserts and for T24 cells 5 µm inserts were used. The migration time was 4 h (MDA-MB-231) or 16 h (T24), respectively. The invasion time was 24 h for both cell lines. Non-migratory or non-invading cells were removed from the upper insert compartment with a cotton bud. Migrating and invading, respectively were visualized by crystal violet staining.

2.7. Cell death assay
Cell death rate was determined with PI- exclusion assays. In brief, cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentration of Soraphen A, washed, stained with 50 µg ml-1 Propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).

2.8. Statistical analysis
All assays were performed three times. Data are expressed as means ± S.E.M and analyzed using one-way-ANOVA + Tukey HSD post hoc or Student`s t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered as significant.

3. Results

3.1. Mass spectrometry measurements
To investigate whether modulations of lipid composition of plasma membranes influence the biomechanical properties of cancer cells and thus their metastatic potential, in a first step the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was treated for 6 hours with the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) inhibitor Soraphen A and a detailed lipidome analysis was performed with ESI tandem mass spectrometry. Extending first reports regarding the effect of Soraphen A on the phospholipid content after long incubation times of 72 hours [14], the ACC inhibitor does not modulate the total phospholipid content (figure 2(a)). Beside total phospholipid content, desaturation in all analyzed phospholipid species increased after treatment with Soraphen A (figure 2(b)-2(e)).
 
Figure 2. Effect of Soraphen A on the phospholipid composition of MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells (5 × 106) were treated with vehicle only (methanol; b-e: white bars) or Soraphen A (100 nM; B-E: dark bars) for 6 h. Extracted phospholipids were analyzed by liquid chromatography ESI tandem mass spectrometry. (a) Total signal intensities of phospholipid subclasses in Soraphen A-treated cells. Relative intensities of individual species were summarized and normalized to the number of cells. 100% corresponds to the signal intensities of vehicle-treated cells and is based on relative units. (b-e) Distribution of phospholipid species depending on their desaturation. Summarized signal intensities are given relative to the total phospholipid subclass intensity. (* p < 0.05, ** p <0.01, *** p < 0.001)

However, the composition of membrane phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), phosphatidylserines (PS), and phosphatidylinositols (PI) is strongly altered by Soraphen A treatment after the short treatment time of only 6 hours (figure 3(a) – 3(d)). The proportion of phospholipids is shifted towards those with longer fatty acid chains, whereas the amount of phospholipids with shorter fatty acid chains significantly declined after incubation with Soraphen A.

Extracted phospholipids were analyzed by liquid chromatography ESI tandem mass spectrometry. (a - d) Distribution of phospholipid species depending on their fatty acid chain length (Student’s t-test, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001). The proportion of phospholipid species (= relative intensity) is given as percentage of the sum of all species in the respective subclass (= 100%). Total phospholipid subclass intensities combine the intensities of all species of the respective subclass and were normalized to the number of cells.

3.2. Biomechanical behavior of cytoskeleton and membrane
Since phospholipids are the main components of cellular membranes, we assumed that Soraphen A induced changes in phospholipid composition might affect rigidity of membranes and deformation of whole cells. Hence, by evaluation of membrane fluctuations [28] bending rigidity of cellular membranes was determined as described in [26,29]. In order to exclude effects of cytoskeletal restrains, membrane rigidity was determined by using giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) [30]. GPMVs are derived from viable cells by vesiculation - an energy, pH, and temperature-dependent procedure. The process is chemically induced by paraformaldehyde (PFA) and potentiated with mono- and divalent cations as well as 1,4-di-thiothreitol (DTT) [30,31]. A contraction of the cytoskeleton induces an increased osmotic pressure inside the cell and pieces of cellular membrane separate from cytoskeleton [32]. Most of the observed vesicles had radii between 5 µm and 15 µm. GPMVs contain numerous membrane lipids and polypeptides in contrast to artificially biomimetic membranes but are devoid of cytoskeletal components [31] like actin, microtubule, or intermediate filaments and thus are free of cytoskeletal restraints. Hypotonic lysis removes cytosolic ingredients. This allows interaction-free measurement of rigidity of cellular membranes via Fourier analysis of thermal vesicle shape fluctuation. Fourier analysis or flicker spectroscopy of the fluctuating vesicle contour is a sensitive method to estimate the bending rigidity ? of thermally excited vesicle membranes. The aggressive cancer cells lines MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cells) and T24 (urinary bladder carcinoma cells) were incubated with 1µM Soraphen A for 2 hours. 35 treated and 46 untreated vesicles obtained from MDA-MB-231 cells were measured and 31 treated and 29 untreated vesicles for T24 cells, respectively.
Interestingly, Soraphen A treated MDA-MB-231 and T24 cells showed a significantly increased number of cellular vesicles with higher bending rigidities in contrast to control cells (figure 4(a) and 4(b)), implicating that inhibition of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase and the resulting modulation of phospholipid composition enhances the rigidity of cellular membranes.

Both show the impact of 1 µM Soraphen A on membrane rigidity, displaying upper quartile, median, mean value, lower quartile and a 10-90% whisker range for ?.

(e, f) Comparison of optical stretcher measurements at the end of the stretch phase (* p < 0.05, ns: not significant).

In addition, optical stretcher measurements were performed to determine whole cell deformation and thus stiffness of cells in the presence of an intact cytoskeleton [20]. Cells were pumped in a microfluidic system, serially stopped in the focus of the phase contrast microscope, and trapped by the laser with 100 mW. A single cell deformation measurement is composed of a 1 s trap of the cell, following a 2 s stretch phase with a laser power of 800 mW, and another trap phase for 2 s to record relaxation. The setup is illustrated in figure 1(a). As shown in figure 4(c), cellular stiffness of MDA-MB-231 cells was increased after incubation with 1 µM Soraphen A for 2 h. In contrast, the Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase inhibitor did not alter deformation of T24 cells (figure 4(d)). The median of the creep deformation J was analyzed at the end of the stretch phase (t = 3 s) as most significant parameter (figure 4(e) and 4(f)). Soraphen A has affected membrane rigidity and cytoskeleton in the breast epithelial cell line, while in the urinary bladder cell line only membrane rigidity was affected.

3.3. Migration and invasion behavior
To investigate whether the decrease in membrane rigidity has a functional impact on metastatic potential of cancer cells, Boyden chamber assays were performed. Soraphen treated cells were detached and plated into uncoated (for analysis of migration) or matrigel coated (for invasion assays) Boyden Chamber inserts (Corning, NY, USA) and allowed to migrate or invade towards a 10% FCS + 100 ng ml-1 EGF gradient. Despite the different behavior of T24 and MDA-MB-231 cells in the optical stretcher experiments, Soraphen A inhibits migration and invasion capacity of both cell lines to a similar extent (figure 5(a) – 5(d)) without significantly affecting cell death (figure 6).

Migration of (a) MDA-MB-231 and (b) T24 cells was analyzed by a Boyden-Chamber migration assay. To analyze invasion of cells a modified Boyden-Chamber assay for (c) MDA-MB-231 and (d) T24 cells was performed. (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001)

4. Discussion
This study demonstrates that Soraphen A as an Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 inhibitor, which modifies fatty acid metabolism, hinders cancer cell migration and invasion via alteration of the mechanical properties of the plasma membrane. Whole cell mechanics where established via optical stretcher measurements and helped distinguish the influence of cytoskeleton and plasma membrane on migration. We were able to demonstrate that modulating membrane rigidity alone, even without affecting stiffness of the whole cell, has a huge impact on cancer cell movement. Mass spectrometry measurements of the lipid composition in cancer cells treated with Soraphen A establish the molecular background of the changed biomechanical properties resulting in decreased membrane rigidity: Fatty acids with higher chain lengths accumulate in a broad range of cellular phospholipids after Soraphen A treatment. Longer lipid chains are harder to bend, i.e. increase rigidity. It is well known that an increment in fatty acid chain length results in increased membrane rigidity due to enhanced Van der Waals interactions between fatty acids [33]. Interestingly, cancer cells isolated from human patients contain higher levels of phospholipids with shorter fatty acid chain length than non-malignant primary samples resulting in softening of the cell membranes as shown in (Händel C, Schmidt B U S, Schiller J, Dietrich U, Kießling T R, Pawlizak S, Fritsch A W, Horn L-C, Briest S, Höckel M, Zink M, Käs J A 2015 Cell Membrane Softening in Human Breast and Cervical Cancer Cells. ). Moreover, treatment with the ACC1 inhibitor resulted in an upregulation of phospholipids with double bonds. Although it is described that enhanced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids hinder dense packing of the membrane and increase the fluidity of the membrane [34], this study implicates that the acyl chain length might dominate plasma membrane rigidity. GPMVs of Soraphen A treated cells have a higher rigidity due to phospholipids composition shift to longer chain length. 
By utilizing GPMVs to determine membrane rigidity without the cytoskeleton, we were able to demonstrate that membrane rigidity plays an important role in regulation of migratory and invasive processes. Membrane rigidity measurements based on Fourier fluctuation analysis have only been applied to vesicles composed of a few synthetic lipids and red blood cells so far [29,5]. GPMVs are plasma membrane blebs without actin filaments and are a new method to study blebbing motion of cancer cells. This aggressive migration is caused by intracellular pressure (actin-myosin contractions) and appears without actin-driven protrusion [35,32]. The blebs can easily adapt to the shape of the extracellular environment and promote cell migration [32,36].
Surprisingly increased membrane rigidity is already sufficient to hinder cell motility. These physical membrane features in combination with changed migration behavior mediated by Soraphen A opens new perspectives in membrane research and probably even in oncology. 
Lowering membrane rigidity might increase invasive potential which is in agreement with a study on primary tumor cells from human patients (Händel C, Schmidt B U S, Schiller J, Dietrich U, Kießling T R, Pawlizak S, Fritsch A W, Horn L-C, Briest S, Höckel M, Zink M, Käs J A 2015 Cell Membrane Softening in Human Breast and Cervical Cancer Cells. ).
Recent results in cancer research suggest that blebbing motion becomes more efficient than mesenchymal motion at tumor margins [37]. We expect that membrane stiffening in particular is a strong inhibitor for amoeboid and blebbing motion and might play a key role in intravasation [38,39]
In summary, modulating membrane rigidity and cell stiffness with the chemical compound Soraphen A allowed us to investigate these important mechanical features for the first time with respect to migration and invasion. These results point to the important role of membrane rigidity in migratory processes, even with unaffected cell stiffness, and demonstrate that membrane rigidity is closer related to cancer progression than previously assumed [40]. Thus, targeting membrane features of cancer cells offer new therapeutic perspectives in cancer biology.
