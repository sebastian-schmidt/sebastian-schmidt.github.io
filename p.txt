Abstract
Biomechanical properties are key to many cellular functions such as cell division or cell motility and thus are crucial in the development and understanding of several diseases, for instance cancer. Mechanics of the cellular cytoskeleton have been extensively characterized in cells and artificial systems. The rigidity of the plasma membrane with the exception of red blood cells has been unknown and membrane rigidity measurements only exist for vesicles composed of a few synthetic lipids. In this study, thermal fluctuations of giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) directly derived from plasma membranes of primary breast and cervical cells, as well as breast cell lines, are analyzed. Cell blebs or GPMVs were studied via thermal membrane fluctuations and mass spectrometry. It is revealed that cancer cell membranes are significantly softer than their non-malignant counterparts. This can be attributed to a loss of fluid raft forming lipids in malignant cells. These results indicate that the reduction of membrane rigidity promotes aggressive blebbing motion in invasive cancer cells.

 
1. Introduction
The plasma membrane of a cell is not only a cell’s barrier to its outside world [1]. It is also an important cell organelle involved in cell signaling, cellular motion, and in the formation of numerous diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s or Niemann-Pick disease [2–4]. The cytoskeleton and the cell membrane are the most important factors characterizing mechanical behavior of cells. Biomechanics of tissues, cells, and plasma membranes regulates the development and homeostasis in tumor progression [5]. These changes, linked to cellular functions, are essential for metastasis and are a distinguishing element in contrast to normal cells [2]. Initially, cancer cells form a solid tumor. At later stages, tumor cells have to pass the tumor boundary, leave their tissue of origin, enter blood vessels, and invade new tissue compartments to become a life threatening systemic disease. The plasma membrane is one of the first elements of a cancer cell that protrudes the vesicular wall in metastasis [6]. Typically, the migration is differentiated as mesenchymal or amoeboid-like [7]. During this process, cells change their mechanical properties, lose cell-cell adhesion and break through the basement membrane [8]. Current studies assume that initiation of metastasis is enabled by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [9,10]. It is estimated that 10 to 40 % of carcinomas pass through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, i.e. a transition of epithelial cells into cells with mesenchymal character [11]. Biomechanics offers the possibility to provide information whether primary tumors contain cells which are able to metastasize [12].
While mechanical changes of cancer cells’ cytoskeleton have become a focus of the emerging field physics of cancer [5,13,14], the role of membrane rigidity gets less exposure. This results from the difficult experimental access to the rigidity ? of physiologically relevant cellular membranes due to the dominating rigidity of the underlying cytoskeleton. Initial approaches of membrane rigidity measurements, using thermal fluctuation analysis, have been attempted in the 1970s and 1980s [15]. However, these measurements have been mostly restricted to pure single component vesicles and red blood cells [16–18]. Several publications, dealing with lipid composition of cancer and healthy cells, provide further indications that cancer affects membrane rigidity. These studies have focused on phospholipid content, the main lipid components of cellular membranes, and have already shown differences in lipid compositions between cancer und healthy cells [19,20]. Barcelo-Coblijn et al. showed that human cancer cells have distinctly lower levels of the raft forming phospholipid sphingomyelin (SM) than non-malignant counterparts [19]. Based on these investigations and the fact that lipid composition strongly affects membrane rigidity [16] we assume a correlation between malignancy of cancer cell membranes and membrane rigidity.
In our work, we present a direct link between membrane rigidity and malignancy of cells obtained from primary tissue. The results are compared with cellular membranes extracted from malignant (MDA-MB-231) and non-malignant (MCF-10A) cell lines. Since the underlying cytoskeletal cortex in all cells is significantly stiffer than the plasma membrane, it is not possible to measure membrane rigidity directly on a cell surface [21]. Only giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) or cellular blebs are initially cortex free and thus allow to probe directly the stiffness of the cell membrane decoupled from the cytoskeleton [22]. Therefore we used cellular blebbing, viz. vesiculation [23] to isolate pieces of the membrane as GPMVs and analyzed their rigidity. GPMVs are bilayer spheres (1 µm to 100 µm) which are produced from biological cells by the vesiculation mechanism. This process is chemically induced by paraformaldehyde (PFA) [23]. In contrast to artificially modeled bilayer spheres or supported bilayers, GPMVs contain a larger variety of lipids and membrane peptides and come closer to physiological membranes. During vesiculation, the membrane dissociates from the actin cortex and small pieces of plasma biomembrane separate from the cytoskeleton. A higher osmotic pressure inside the cells, induced by a contraction of the cytoskeleton, leads to the formation of GPMVs [24–26]. The cytosolic components are removed by hypotonic lysis. Scott et. al. show that GPMVs contain polypeptides, are free of intracellular organelles, and cytoskeletal restraints [22]. Within the blebs, an actin-myosin cortex is not visible [27,25]. To study changes in bending rigidity between cell membranes of cancer and normal cells, we applied Fourier fluctuation analysis of thermally excited membrane undulations [16,28]. GPMV fluctuations were recorded and bending rigidities determined via Fourier fluctuation analysis, a force-free technique previously applied to artificial vesicles [16]. In addition, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption & ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to characterize the lipid cell membrane composition [29] and correlated the results with bending rigidity measurements of cell membranes obtained from the same cell type.
Based on Fourier fluctuation analysis of GPMVs we found a significant membrane softening in human cancer cells compared to their non-malignant counterparts. We attribute these results to a loss of sphingomyelin (SM 16:0) and an increased proportion of phosphatidylcholines (PC) with shorter fatty acid chain lengths in malignant cells in contrast to normal ones.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Tumor dissociation and culturing of primary cells
Use of mammary and cervical tumor samples obtained from the Leipzig university hospital was approved by the ethics committee of the medical department of the Leipzig university. All patients in this study signed a consent document prior to surgery. After tumor classification by the pathology department, the remaining vital tissue was processed for cell isolation and culturing.
Tumor and healthy tissue was obtained from patients by surgical excision. Surgical excision of mammary and cervical tissue was performed at Leipzig university hospital. Figure 1 shows tissue samples of a human breast tumor and how cells were extracted.
 
Figure 1. Tissue sample preparation. (a) Pieces of a tissue sample (human breast tumor and the respective normal counterparts) obtained from a patient by surgical excision. (b) The tissue sample was cut into smaller pieces of about 1 mm3. (c) The tissue was digested with collagenase and DNase to obtain isolated epithelial cells.

In order to dissociate tissue samples (figure 1(a)) and extract a cell monolayer, samples were cut into smaller pieces of about 1 mm³ (figure 1(b)). Digestion was performed in a gentleMACS C tube (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) containing 5 ml Dulbecco's Modified Eagle/HAM’s F-12 nutrient medium (DMEM/HAM’s F12, Biochrom, FG 4815) and 20 µg ml-1 DNase (AppliChem A3778, 0010). For breast tissue 1.6 mg ml-1 collagenase P (Roche, 11213857001) was added. For cervical tissue 0.25 mg ml-1 collagenase 1A (Sigma-Aldrich, C9722) and 0.25 mg ml-1 pronase (Roche, 10165 921001) was added. Tissue in tubes was processed in gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) at varying speeds and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humid atmosphere for 30-60 min. The last step was repeated until over 80% of tissue was dissociated.
Cell suspension was centrifuged in two steps (at 40 g for 1 min and 300 g for 10 min) to separate epithelial cells from clusters, debris, and other cell types such as fibroblasts [30]. The remaining cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM/HAM’s F12, supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Biochrom, S 0615) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic Solution (Sigma-Aldich, A5955), and cultured in 6-well plates with the same cell culture medium. After 24 hours, medium was exchanged with serum-free HuMEC medium (Life Technologies, 12752-010) for breast cancer cells or with defined Keratinocyte serum-free medium (Life Technologies, 10744-019) for cervical cells. Both media were supplemented with 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic Solution. Cell medium was renewed every 2 to 3 days.
Since passaging of cells can influence their biomechanical behavior in vitro, primary cell membranes were obtained from cells which had not been passaged before and were only in culture for 5-10 days. Cells were grown to approximately 90% confluence in 75 cm² culture flasks prior to the vesiculation process (figure 1(c)).

2.2. Culturing of cell lines
Non-malignant MCF-10A breast epithelial cells (ATCC, CRL-10317) were cultured in 1:1 DMEM/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 100 ng ml-1 Cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich, C8052), 20 ng ml-1 human epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich, E9644), 10 µg ml-1 insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, I9278), 500 ng ml-1 hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, H0888) and 5% horse serum (PAA Laboratories, B15-021) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere. Cells were cultured in 75 cm² flasks (TPP). Culture medium was changed every 2 to 3 days.
For passaging or extraction of lipids for mass spectrometry, cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Life Technologies, 18912-014) and detached by adding 1 ml 0.025% trypsin/EDTA solution (trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Biochrom, L2143). Before centrifugation at 100 g for 4 min, cells were resuspended in 5 ml culture medium to neutralize trypsin. The trypsin containing medium was removed after centrifugation and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml culture medium. The cell suspension was either processed further by the Bligh & Dyer method to extract the lipids [31] or cultured again in a new flask with fresh medium under the same conditions described above.
Malignant MDA-MB-231 (ATCC, HTB-26) breast epithelial cells were cultured in 90% DMEM, supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere. Cells were cultured in 75 cm² flasks. Cell medium was renewed every 2 to 3 days. Subculturing and lipid extraction were done in the same way as described above for MCF-10A cells.

2.3. Giant plasma membrane vesicles
Cells were grown to approximately 90% confluence in 75 cm² tissue culture flasks prior to the vesiculation process. After removing of cell culture medium, cells were rinsed twice with warm GPMV buffer. The GPMV buffer, composed of 150 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S7653), 10 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, Sigma-Aldrich, H3375) and 2 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, C5080) was prepared with ultra-pure water (Milli-Q system, Integral 5, Merck Millipore, r >18 M??cm).
In order to trigger vesiculation, 2.5 ml GPMV buffer, including 25 mM PFA (Sigma-Aldrich, P6148) and 4 mM 1,4 di-thiothreitol (DTT, Roth, 6908), was added to the washed cell monolayer [23,32]. Mono- and divalent cations, disulfide reducing agents such as DTT and hypertonic medium potentiate the vesiculation process [22]. DTT potentiate the vesiculation process due to reduction of disulfide bonds. The pretreatment of cells, e.g. with chemical agents that destroy the cytoskeleton, is not necessary. Disrupting the microfilaments and microtubules induces no detectable effect on vesiculation [33,34]. The blebbing of the GPMVs was carried out in a shaker during 120 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 60 cycle min-1. After incubation, the content of the flask was decanted into a 15 ml centrifuge tube containing 4 ml GPMV buffer solution and settled on ice for 45 min. The upper ¾ of the solution in the centrifuge tube contains most of the GPMVs and was pipetted directly on a microscope slide and immediately observed by phase contrast microscopy (LEICA, DM IRB) for imaging with 100× magnification. A representative GPMV obtained from primary mamma carcinoma cells is shown in figure 2(a).

2.4. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric lipid characterization
About 600 µl of the obtained cellular lipid extracts (~5? 106 cells) were dried under vacuum and subsequently re-solubilized by addition of 10 µl matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB, 0.5 M in methanol, Sigma-Aldrich, 39319) [35]. The lipid moiety of cells was extracted according to Bligh and Dyer method [31]. 1 µl of the sample/matrix mixture was transferred onto a gold-coated MALDI target. To overcome assignment problems (interferences between differences in the fatty acyl compositions of lipids and the simultaneous generation of H+ and Na+ adducts), selected analyses were repeated with the same DHB matrix solution that has been saturated with cesium chloride (CsCl, ICN, 150589) and used as described in [36]. All MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Autoflex MS device (Bruker Daltonics). The system utilizes a pulsed nitrogen laser, emitting at 337 nm. All measurements were performed in the reflector mode using delayed extraction conditions. Positive ion spectra were exclusively recorded. Raw data were processed using the software "Flex Analysis" version 2.2 (Bruker Daltonics). The intensities of the observed peaks are given relative to the intensity of the most intense peak. Further information regarding MALDI MS analysis of lipids is available in [29].

2.5. Fourier analysis of thermally excited membrane fluctuations
The vesicles were observed by phase contrast microscopy to image their contour (figure 2(a)). Here sequences of n images (? 10,000) per vesicle were recorded with an iXon camera (Andor) with rates between 90 and 150 frames per second depending on the binning. An acquisition time (? 1 min) was used which guarantees that GPMVs were able to move through most of its available configurations [37].
 
Figure 2. Determination of the bending elastic modulus. (a) Phase contrast image of a GPMV obtained from isolated primary cells. (b) Contour of a GPMV extracted from a self-written edge detection algorithm. (c) Bending elastic moduli ? (rigidity) of a GPMV as function of the wave vector q. Modes 2<q<9 were used to determine the bending elastic modulus of vesicles.

Based on the vesicle edges, bending rigidities ? were calculated by a Fourier analysis of thermal vesicle shape fluctuation [16,32]. Fourier analysis of the fluctuating vesicle contour (fluctuation or flicker spectroscopy) is a highly sensitive method to investigate the bending rigidity ? of thermally excited membranes [32].
This method goes back to Helfrich in 1973 [38]. It describes the free energy E for bending a fluid bilayer membrane as an integral over the surface A:
 . 									(1)
c1 and c2 are principle curvatures and c0 the spontaneous curvature. The theory was extended to quasi-spherical vesicles by Schneider et al. in 1984 [39]. This model is based on displacements u(?,?,t) of a vesicle from its spherical form and it provides even today an experimental access to bending rigidity ?. The relative deformations are decomposed in spherical harmonic eigenfunctions Ylq(?,?) and their time-dependent amplitudes alq(t):
 .								(2)
l denotes the azimuthal and q the magnetic quantum number. Spherical harmonics are further characterized by the polar angle ? and the azimuthal angle ?. Deformations of vesicles were expressed as second order series expansion [39]:
 . 									(3)
R0 is the average radius and R(?,?,t) the current radius of the vesicle. The sum in equation (2) starts at l = 2. States with l = 0 do not conserve the volume and states with l = 1 correspond to translations of the sphere. Schneider et al. showed further a relation between free energy E of quasi-spherical, symmetric (c0 = 0) bilayers and time-dependent amplitudes alq(t):
  .						(4)
In equation (4) ?' denotes an effective tension and can be negative for strongly deflated vesicles [37].
The assumption that single oscillating modes are independent (hydrodynamic theory) allows the calculation of time dependent amplitudes alq from each spherical harmonic. Using the equipartition theorem leads to:
  . 					(5)
T denotes the temperature and kB the Boltzmann constant. The expected value is calculated as ensemble average.
Engelhardt et al. correlated the observed 2D shape fluctuations from the equatorial plane to Schneider’s 3D theory [32]. This was realized with a Fourier analysis of the observed fluctuating contour. A self-written Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA ) gradient based edge detection algorithm was employed to detect the contours of the individual vesicles with subpixel resolution (figure 2(a) and 2(b)). The edge detection program describes the contour of each vesicle with N = 256 radii R(?i). R denotes the radius and ?i the azimuthal angle of the vesicles contour in the image plane (? = ?/2). After Fourier transformation, the relative deformations u(?,t) can be expressed as amplitudes Vq(t) in the equatorial plane:
 . 									(6)
Together with eq. (2) and (5) follows for mean square values:
 .							(7)
The mean square values of the Fourier coefficients Vq were calculated by averaging Vq² over the number of taken images n. Nlq P(q)l (0) are fully normalized associated Legendre functions at ? = 90°. To calculate the bending rigidity ? a two-parameter fit was necessary. The fit was done to check the influence of surface tension (figure 3).
 
Figure 3. Surface tension ? as a function of bending rigidity ?. The plot shows a representative giant plasma membrane vesicle obtained from primary breast cancer cells. The black line shows the average of 256 curves (blue).

Here it was found that the effect of surface tension to bending rigidity was smaller than the observed differences between normal and cancer cells. For that reason the simplification from Engelhardt et al. was used [32]:
 .								(8)
R in equation (8) is derived by averaging R0 of each single image over all images n. The sum in equation (8) was calculated in agreement with Engelhardt et al. up to the 34th order [32]. Nevertheless, only the modes 2 < q < 9 were used to determine the bending elastic modulus of vesicles in the present work. In this range we observed relatively constant bending moduli (figure 2(c)) and we can assume that in these modes tension effects can be neglected. As shown previously, lower order modes (q < 3) are dominated by gravitational forces and non-linear surface tension effects [40]. The latter one affects surface undulations leading to systematically too high bending moduli [32]. Higher order modes (q > 8) were not considered because the response time of the oscillation decreases rapidly with increasing degree l and comes in the range of the sampling time. The Fourier transformation from equation (6) was realized with a discrete transformation. A typical distribution of bending modes q of one single GPMV is illustrated in figure 2(c).

3. Results

3.1. Increased membrane softening in human breast and cervical cells
In this study tumor samples of breast and cervical cancer patients were analyzed and compared with measurements from two different breast epithelial cell lines (non-malignant MCF 10A and malignant MDA-MB-231). For both tumor types, corresponding normal epithelial cells from the same patient were used as reference. This allowed for a comparison of plasma membranes obtained from cancer and non-malignant cells. Additionally, possible artefacts caused by the physical condition of the patient can be neglected. The isolation of a cell monolayer from primary tissue samples and cell culturing are described in more detail above. Afterwards, GPMV formation (vesiculation) was induced by adding PFA to the cell monolayer. Most of the observed GPMVs had diameters between 10 µm and 30 µm. Based on the vesicle edges, observed via phase contrast microscopy, bending rigidities were calculated by a Fourier analysis. For our calculation, only flaccid vesicles with a low excess area compared to the minimal spherical shape were analyzed to avoid membranes under mechanical tension.
Figure 4(b) und 4(c) show representative measurements of bending rigidity of GPMVs, received from primary breast and cervical cells.

(d) Boxplots of distributions from (a) – (c) displaying upper quartile, median, mean value, lower quartile, and a 10-90 % whisker range. Primary carcinoma and healthy cells within one distribution diagram were obtained from the same patient. Values of bending elastic moduli in (a) - (c) show the median of the distribution.

As reference we measured the bending rigidities of GPMVs obtained from two breast cell lines, non-malignant MCF-10A (ATCC, CRL-10317) and malignant MDA-MB-231 (ATCC, HTB-26) breast epithelial cells. These cell lines, shown in figure 4(a), constitute an established model system to compare the behavior of cancerous and healthy cells [41]. For primary breast and cervical cancer cells we found a significantly increased number of GPMVs with lower bending rigidities in contrast to GPMVs obtained from normal tissue of the same patient (figure 4(b) and 4(c)). The rigidity of primary mamma cell membranes shows a fourfold decreased median for cancer cells compared to normal cells (figure 4(b)). The decrease of bending rigidity was also found for membranes of breast cell lines and primary cervix cells. A difference by a factor of 2 was found for membranes of primary cervix cancer cells and 2.8 for membranes of the malignant breast cell line compared to their normal counterparts. We attribute the smaller effect for cell lines compared to primary cells to long culture times of cell lines and the resulting changes to lipid composition. Figure 4(d) shows boxplots of distributions from figure 4(a) – 4(c). The boxplots of primary cells and cell lines displaying upper quartile, median, mean value, lower quartile, and a 10-90 % whisker range.

3.2. MALDI-TOF analysis of lipid composition
To investigate if there is a correlation between membrane rigidity and lipid composition in cancer cells compared to their non-malignant counterparts, positive ion matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) was employed for all investigated samples. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a modern and sensitive tool to analyze biomolecules such as proteins and lipids. This soft-ionization technique enables the analysis of the sample without a significant extent of fragmentation of the analyte of interest. Relative amounts of the individual lipids can be easily determined by the comparison of the peak intensities. Here, two significant effects were found. First, we observed a decreased level of sphingomyelin (SM 16:0) in primary cancer cells in contrast to normal ones making out about 30 - 40 % (changes were normalized to the base peak - the most common membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (16:0/20:4)), see figure 5.
 
Figure 5. Positive ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra of primary cells. Mass spectra show ranges of most common phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholines (16:0/18:1) and (16:0/20:4) as well as sphingomyelin (16:0 SM). Mass spectrum of (a) normal primary mammary cells and (b) primary mammary carcinoma cells obtained from the same patient. Mass spectrum of (c) normal primary cervical cells and (d) primary cervical carcinoma cells.

This result is consistent with Barcelo-Coblijn et al. [19]. A higher amount of SM in cellular membranes decreases the mobility [42] since SM constitutes a more condensed state of fluid membranes, predominantly found in lipid rafts [43]. Therefore we assume that the SM content is important for the higher bending modulus of GPMVs of healthy cells. Secondly, we measured an increased proportion of phosphatidylcholines (PC) with shorter fatty acid chain lengths in malignant cells compared to non-malignant cells. A shorter chain length reduces the tendency of the hydrocarbon chains to interact with each other by Van der Waals forces and increases the fluidity of the membrane. Moreover, short lipid chains could act like a hinge and are easier to bend in a membrane. Thus, both changes in lipid composition result in a more dynamic and more bendable membrane. Beside chain lengths of fatty acids, an increased proportion of fatty acids with a higher degree of desaturation was found in non-malignant cells compared to malignant cells of the same patient (figure 5). An increased number of double bonds should hinder a dense packing and yields lower rigidity. However, our measurements show that the chain length has a larger impact on rigidity, since GPMVs of malignant cells have a lower bending moduli by a simultaneous increasing moiety of lipids with shorter chain lengths. The results are consistent with (Braig S, Schmidt B U S, Ferkaljuk K, Händel C, Werz O, Müller R, Zahler S, Koeberle A, Käs J A, Vollmar A M 2015 Modulation of Membrane Rigidity Impacts Cell Migration and Invasion. ). 

4. Discussion
In our work we found a direct correlation between the rigidity of cellular membranes and the malignancy of the corresponding cells. In summary, we measured a significant softening of rigidity in primary human breast and cervical carcinoma cell membranes. These results were confirmed with malignant and non-malignant cell lines. Mass spectrometric measurements indicate two molecular reasons for softening in malignant cell membranes: a decreased level of SM 16:0 and an increased level of PCs with shorter fatty acid chain lengths, which both reduce membrane rigidity. A decreased rigidity in plasma membranes of malignant cells with a simultaneously increased proportion of lipids with shorter chain lengths was found. It is concluded that chain length and sphingomyelin content have a stronger influence on rigidity than the double bond contents of lipids. Moreover, it was assumed that transmembrane peptides do not alter the membrane stiffness significantly [37] and peptides could therefore not be responsible for such drastic changes in membrane rigidity.
The changes in lipid composition in cancer cells not only influence cell signaling by reducing lipid rafts but also impact the bending properties of the cell membrane [44]. The reduction of raft forming lipids might lead to faster cell signaling [44]. Both effects might have a decisive role in the progression of cancer and are therefore potential oncology targets.
The decrease in membrane rigidity support the blebbing motion [45,46] as an alternative to mesenchymal motion because cellular blebs formation occurs without actin filaments. The blebbing motion facilitates cancer cells the migration through the extracellular matrix gel or connective tissue. This amoeboid-like, directed, and persistent migration occurs without actin-driven protrusion. The bleb formation is driven by intracellular pressure, caused by actin-myosin contractions [24,26]. Due to the lack of the cortex, the blebs can easily adapt to the shape of the extracellular environment [24]. This facilitates the cell migration, since cells can “squeeze” themselves through existing gaps in the matrix [47]. The detachment of the cell membrane from the underlying cytoskeleton is caused by a loss of the focal adhesion protein mediated linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the cell membrane. Local adhesion energy between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane is directly regulated by binding interactions. In this local disintegration of cortex-membrane junctions, not only the protein-binding partners are involved; the lipid composition of the membrane bilayer has also an impact in this interaction [48]. It is proven, that the local release of membrane lipids, e.g. the second messenger PIP2, controls the actin dynamics in specific subcellular regions [49,50] and regulates the adhesion energy between cytoskeleton and plasma membrane [51]. This process is realized by a cyclic binding of PIP2 to actin filament cross-linking target proteins which accumulate in cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains [52,53]. It has been proven, that cholesterol also influences the mechanical properties, such as bending rigidity of lipid membranes due to modifying the acyl chain order and thus probably influencing the migration behavior. However, the effect depends on the individual molecular architecture of the lipid membranes [37].
Concluding, the reduced rigidity could be a significant advantage during tumor propagation and invasion when a cancer cell squeezes between two cells of a vesicular wall. These results are supported by a migration study on cancer cell lines (Braig S, Schmidt B U S, Ferkaljuk K, Händel C, Werz O, Müller R, Zahler S, Koeberle A, Käs J A, Vollmar A M 2015 Modulation of Membrane Rigidity Impacts Cell Migration and Invasion. ).  This study – a combination of clinical samples along with biomechanical techniques to determine the rigidity of cell membranes – offers a new perspective in cancer biology. It can lead to a better understanding of other non-neoplastic diseases such as cardiovascular problems and diseases connected to abnormalities of lipid metabolism in which changes in lipid composition are also relevant.
